# GitHub Basics
    This repository is only intended for use by team members
    in the "New Vuyiroli Website" team
    in CIS320 - Project Management in Information Technology.

Through this assignment, you will learn about:
* GitHub registration and organizations
* Repositories (aka repos)
* Markdown
* Forks
* Branches
* Commits
* Pull Requests

`user` refers to your GitHub username

## Initial setup
1. If you do not already have a GitHub account, go to https://github.com/join and go through the guided process.
1. Email Matt at `matt -dot- beall -at- me -dot- com`. He will add you to the organization `c320vws` so that you can create/manage issues and pull requests for the various repos.
1. Go to https://github.com/c320vws/github-basics and click on "Fork." This creates a copy of `c320vws/github-basics` under your personal account, at `user/github-basics`.

## Making changes using a branch

1. Go to `user/github-basics`, click on the dropdown menu that says "branch: master" and type in the first four letters of your last name and the first two letters of your first name (i.e. `llllff`). For example, Matt Beall would become `bealma`. Hit `ENTER`. This creates a branch (copy) of the `master` branch.
1. Using the branch you just created, click on the `names.md` file. Click "Edit." In this screen, you can go back and forth between the "Code" view and the "Preview."
1. In the "Code" view, underneath `# Names`, add your first and last name to the bottom of the list.
1. In the "Commit changes" dialog, add a title for the change like "Added Matt Beall to list".
1. If you want, you can add an optional extended description. For this commit, this doesn't really make sense, but the description may prove useful later.
1. Click "Commit changes."

## Merging changes into master branch
Now that you have added your name to the `names.md` file in the `llllff` branch, it's time to merge those changes into the `master` branch.
1. Go to `user/github-basics` and make sure that you are in the correct branch. To change the branch, select the dropdown menu.
1. Click on the green button to the left of the branch dropdown.
1. On the next screen, it should default to the correct settings, but take note of them anyway. The
